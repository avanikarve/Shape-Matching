# Shape Matching Algorithm

## Objective  
The goal of this project is to match shapes in images using a centroid-based distance profile algorithm. This method is both scale and rotation invariant. The code explains the matching process in detail and demonstrates how it works using a set of reference and test images.

## Files  
- Code: `Shape_Matching_AMK.ipynb` (contains detailed explanation and implementation)  
- Images: `A.png`, `B.png`, `C.png`, `D.png`, `E.png` (reference shapes), and `testD.png` (test image)
